# Probability & Statistics Cheat Sheet
A collection of notes on basic probability and statistics.

## The Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook in the `notebook` directory will contain the explanatory part of this repository. 

The aim is to include
- the mathematical formulas
- the corresponding implementation in Python
- an overview of some possible use cases
- if applicable, a visualisation in the form of a plot

## The Python Library

At a later stage, the implementations discussed in the Jupyter notebook may be included in the `library` as a probability & statistics package. 

I am well aware that there are already libraries, most of which are probably much better implementations, but I see this project mainly as an exercise and learning experience for myself.
