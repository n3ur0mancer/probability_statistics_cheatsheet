    "\n",
    "A random variable is a mathematical abstraction used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the outcomes of a random experiment. It assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome, allowing us to analyze and work with the probability distribution of those outcomes. Random variables come in two main types: discrete and continuous. Discrete random variables can only take on a countable set of distinct values, such as the result of rolling a die or the number of emails received in a day. Continuous random variables, on the other hand, can assume any value within a specified range, such as the height of individuals in a population or the time it takes for a process to complete."

    "A continuous random variable is a type of random variable that can take on any value within a specified range or interval. Unlike discrete random variables, which can only assume distinct and separate values, continuous random variables have an infinite number of possible values within their range. These values are typically associated with measurements or quantities that can be expressed as real numbers.\n",

A smaller SE indicates higher precision, meaning the sample statistic is likely to be closer to the population parameter.

Even with random sampling, different samples from the same population can yield slightly different estimates. The SE quantifies this variability.\n",
